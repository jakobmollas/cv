                        multinational development project with the aim of developing a completely new
                        electronic traffic tolling system. The subsystem is responsible for monitoring,
                        configuring, and debugging the physically distributed tolling system. In addition,
                        he worked hands-on with the development of these applications, primarily with
                        various security-related systems. These systems use customer-specific proprietary
                        hardware to encrypt, decrypt and sign data (both symmetrically and asymmetrically).
                        The development of the software for handling this hardware was relatively complex as
                        much of the work had to be done from scratch. The work also included a lot of review
                        of specifications and documentation related to this hardware.</span>
