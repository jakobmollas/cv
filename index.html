                    <p>Jakob is a curious, pragmatic and result oriented developer. He prefers to
                        work
                        in small, dedicated teams having a great deal of shared responsibility. He strives for solutions
                        that are clear, simple and easy to understand and maintain. Driven by principles like Clean
                        Code/Architecture, DRY, KISS and No broken windows.</p>
                    <p>Jakob is communicative and thrives both deep down in technical details and in
                        strategic discussions with product owners and various stakeholders. Being able to look beyond
                        the next delivery and constantly striving for stable solutions that last over time is also an
                        important quality.</p>
                    <p>The experience from many different industries and roles means that Jakob can
                        take on roles and responsibilities based on the needs of the current team, organization and

                        configuration, troubleshooting, data collection and integration with third-party
                        systems within the traffic tolling industry. The applications are complex, business
                        critical and a lot of focus is placed on stability, reliability, security and
                        accuracy.</p>

                    <p class="body">Jakob worked as a technical project manager for a subsystem in a
                        multinational development project with the aim of developing a completely new
                        electronic traffic tolling system. The subsystem is responsible for monitoring,
                        configuring, and debugging the physically distributed tolling system. In addition,
                        he worked hands-on with the development of these applications, primarily with
                        various security-related systems. These systems use customer-specific proprietary
                        hardware to encrypt, decrypt and sign data (both symmetrically and asymmetrically).
                        The development of the software for handling this hardware was relatively complex as
                        much of the work had to be done from scratch. The work also included a lot of review
                        of specifications and documentation related to this hardware.</p>
